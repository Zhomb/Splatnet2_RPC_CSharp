## Questions? Answers.

##### This isnt my current game? why cant it show my current game?
The splatnet API does not give us the current game, only the last game played.

##### What is config.txt?
This is where your cookie is stored. Keep it safe because if someone gets a hold of your cookie they can easily get your results, which isnt fine.

## Known issues
- Closing discord while the program is running will lead to an unstopable error, which requires the program to restart manually
